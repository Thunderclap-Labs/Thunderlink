# Implementation Summary: Satellite Filtering Feature

## ✅ Completed Tasks

All planned features have been successfully implemented:

### 1. ✅ Satellite Filter Store
- **File**: `store/settingsStore.ts`
- Extended settings store with satellite filtering capabilities
- Added state management for selected satellite and accessible ground stations
- Includes clear filter functionality

### 2. ✅ Search UI Component
- **File**: `components/EarthScene.tsx`
- Added search input field in left control panel
- Implemented autocomplete dropdown with satellite suggestions
- Shows satellite name and category in suggestions
- Clear button to reset filter

### 3. ✅ Pass Prediction Algorithm
- **File**: `utils/satelliteUtils.ts`
- Implemented `predictSatellitePasses()` function
- Calculates satellite passes over ground stations for 24 hours
- Returns detailed pass information (times, duration, elevation)
- Includes helper function `getAccessibleGroundStations()`

### 4. ✅ Visual Filtering
- **File**: `components/EarthScene.tsx`
- Filters satellites to show only selected one
- Hides non-accessible ground stations
- Updates in real-time as satellite moves

### 5. ✅ Visual Indicators
- **Satellite Highlighting**: 
  - Magenta/purple color for filtered satellite
  - Larger size (2x normal)
  - Enhanced glow effect
  - Extended orbit trail
- **Ground Station Highlighting**:
  - Bright green for accessible stations
  - Enhanced emissive intensity
  - Visibility toggle based on accessibility
- **Connection Lines**:
  - Automatically enabled when filtering
  - Magenta color for filtered satellite
  - Higher opacity for better visibility

### 6. ✅ Pass Predictions Panel
- **File**: `components/EarthScene.tsx`
- Modal displaying all ground station passes
- Shows start/end times, duration, max elevation
- Export to CSV functionality
- Beautiful card-based UI

## 📁 Files Modified

1. **store/settingsStore.ts**
   - Added satellite filtering state
   - Added methods for managing filter state

2. **utils/satelliteUtils.ts**
   - Added `PassPrediction` interface
   - Implemented `predictSatellitePasses()` function
   - Implemented `getAccessibleGroundStations()` function

3. **components/EarthScene.tsx**
   - Added search input UI
   - Added active filter display card
   - Added pass predictions modal
   - Implemented satellite filtering logic
   - Implemented ground station visibility logic
   - Enhanced connection line display
   - Added multiple useEffect hooks for state management

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Color Scheme
- **Filtered Satellite**: Magenta (#ff00ff)
- **Accessible Ground Stations**: Bright Green (#00ff00)
- **Connection Lines**: Magenta (#ff00ff)
- **Normal Satellites**: Cyan (#00ffff)

### Size Changes
- **Filtered Satellite**: 0.04 units (2x normal)
- **Normal Satellite**: 0.02 units
- **Filtered Glow**: 0.25 scale (67% larger)

### Opacity Changes
- **Filtered Connections**: 0.6 (2x normal)
- **Normal Connections**: 0.3
- **Filtered Satellite Glow**: 0.8

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
- Pass predictions calculated once per satellite selection
- Connection line pool for efficient reuse
- Ref-based state access in animation loop
- Conditional rendering of ground stations
- Visibility toggles instead of mesh recreation

### State Management
- Zustand store for persistent state
- React refs for animation loop access
- Multiple useEffect hooks for separation of concerns
- Automatic connection enabling on filter

### Algorithm Efficiency
- 1-minute time step for pass calculations
- 24-hour prediction window
- Filters passes shorter than 30 seconds
- Real-time position updates every 2 seconds
