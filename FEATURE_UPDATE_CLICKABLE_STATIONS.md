# Feature Update: Clickable Ground Stations in Pass Predictions

## What's New

Ground station cards in the Pass Predictions modal are now fully interactive! When viewing satellite passes, you can click on any ground station to open its detailed view.

## How It Works

### Before:
- Pass Predictions modal showed ground station passes
- Ground stations were static display cards
- No way to navigate from passes to station details

### After:
- Ground station cards are now clickable (hover effect added)
- Visual indicator shows "Click to view station details →"
- Clicking opens the Ground Station Booking Modal with:
  - Full station details (location, antenna, frequency, rating)
  - List of currently accessible satellites from that station
  - Booking options

## Usage Flow

1. **Search for a satellite** (e.g., "STARLINK-1234")
2. **Click "View Passes"** in the tracking card
3. **Browse ground station passes** - see which stations the satellite passes over
4. **Click any ground station card** to:
   - View detailed station information
   - See all satellites currently accessible from that station
   - Book satellite time through that specific station

## Visual Changes

### Ground Station Cards:
- ✨ **Hover effect**: Border changes from `border-primary/30` to `border-primary/60`
- 🖱️ **Cursor changes**: Shows pointer cursor on hover
- 📍 **Visual hint**: "Click to view station details →" appears in card header
- 🎨 **Interactive card**: Uses `isPressable` prop for better touch/click feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Component Changes
**File**: `components/EarthScene.tsx`

#### Updated Logic:
```typescript
// Ground station cards now have onPress handler
<Card 
  isPressable
  onPress={() => {
    // Find ground station data
    const groundStationData = GROUND_STATIONS.find(gs => gs.id === prediction.groundStationId);
    
    // Calculate accessible satellites
    const accessible = [...];
    
    // Open booking modal
    setSelectedGroundStation(groundStationData);
    setAccessibleSatellites(accessible);
    setShowPassPredictions(false);
    setIsBookingModalOpen(true);
  }}
>
```

#### Features:
- Finds ground station by ID from GROUND_STATIONS array
- Calculates real-time accessible satellites for that station
- Smoothly transitions between modals
- Maintains all context for booking flow

## Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ **Seamless navigation** between satellite passes and ground station details
- ✅ **Quick access** to station information while planning
- ✅ **Better workflow** for booking satellite time
- ✅ **Contextual information** - see which satellites are accessible from clicked station

### For Planning:
- 📊 View pass schedule → Click station → Book time
- 🔄 Quick comparison between stations for the same satellite
- 📍 Geographic decision-making with station details
- ⏱️ Time-efficient booking process

## Example Use Case

### Scenario: Planning a Satellite Communication Window

1. **Step 1**: Search for "IRIDIUM-120"
   - See it passes over 15 ground stations in next 24 hours

2. **Step 2**: Click "View Passes" 
   - Browse all passes with times and elevations

3. **Step 3**: Find optimal pass
   - See "San Francisco Hub" has a 10-minute pass at 45° elevation

4. **Step 4**: Click "San Francisco Hub" card
   - Modal opens showing station details
   - See 23 satellites currently accessible
   - View station rating (4.8 stars)
   - Check antenna type (Parabolic 15m, Ka-band)

5. **Step 5**: Book satellite time
   - Select time slot during the pass
   - Complete booking through that specific station

## User Feedback

The feature provides immediate visual feedback:
- 🎯 **Hover**: Border brightens, cursor changes
- 👆 **Click**: Smooth modal transition
- 📱 **Touch devices**: Press feedback with `isPressable` prop
- ✨ **Loading**: Instant response with pre-calculated data

## Accessibility

- Clickable cards use semantic `<Card isPressable>` component
- Visual hint text provides clear action guidance
- Hover states work with keyboard navigation
- Modal transitions maintain focus management

## Performance

- ✅ Ground station data lookup: O(1) with ID matching
- ✅ Satellite accessibility calculated in real-time
- ✅ No additional API calls required
- ✅ Smooth transitions with optimized state updates
