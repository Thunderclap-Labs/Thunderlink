## 📊 Technical Architecture

### State Management

**Settings Store** (`settingsStore.ts`):
```typescript
{
  filters: {
    country: string,
    timezone: string,
    amount: number
  }
}
```

**Ground Station Store** (`groundStationStore.ts`):
```typescript
{
  customStations: CustomGroundStation[],
  addStation(),
  removeStation(),
  updateStation(),
  toggleStationStatus()
}
```

### Data Flow

1. **Satellite Fetching**:
   ```
   CelesTrak API → fetchSatelliteTLEData() → Apply Settings Filters → Display on Globe
   ```

2. **Ground Stations**:
   ```
   GROUND_STATIONS (35 default) + customStations → Merge → Render on Globe → Show in Management UI
   ```

3. **Auto-Refresh**:
   ```
   Modal Opens → Start 15s Interval → Calculate New Position → Update Display → Clean up on Close
   ```
