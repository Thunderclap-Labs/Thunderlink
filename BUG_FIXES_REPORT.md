# üéâ Major Bug Fixes & Feature Additions - October 4, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Toggle Buttons Not Working
**Problem**: After clicking "Hide Satellites" or "Hide Stations", they would not reappear when clicking "Show"

**Root Cause**: Stars reference was not stored, causing visibility toggles to fail

**Solution**:
- Added `starsRef` to store stars object reference
- Stars are now properly toggled with satellites and ground stations
- All visibility toggles now work reliably

**Code Changes**:
- Line 82: Added `starsRef` state
- Line 203: Stored stars reference `starsRef.current = stars`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Only 30 Satellites Appearing
**Problem**: Slider had range 10-500 but only ~30 satellites were fetching from API

**Root Cause**: Satellite fetch limits were too restrictive (10, 8, 6, 6 per category = 30 total)

**Solution**: **MASSIVELY INCREASED** satellite limits:
- **Iridium**: 10 ‚Üí **100** satellites
- **Globalstar**: 8 ‚Üí **50** satellites
- **Intelsat**: 6 ‚Üí **60** satellites
- **SES**: 6 ‚Üí **50** satellites
- **Added Geostationary**: **100** satellites
- **Added Orbcomm**: **40** satellites
- **Added Starlink**: **100** satellites
- **Added OneWeb**: **80** satellites

**New Total**: **580+ satellites available!**

**File Modified**: `vsls:/utils/satelliteUtils.ts` lines 29-36

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Blue Lines Behind Globe
**Problem**: Connection lines were rendering behind Earth, creating visual glitches

**Root Cause**: Missing depth testing configuration for line materials

**Solution**:
- Added `depthTest: true` to line material
- Added `depthWrite: false` to prevent depth buffer pollution
- Lines now only render in front of Earth

**Code Changes**:
- Line 374-377: Added depth configuration to connection line material

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Stars Missing from Background
**Status**: Stars were actually already present but reference wasn't stored

**Solution**:
- Confirmed stars are rendering (10,000 particles)
- Added proper reference storage for visibility controls
- Stars now persist and can be toggled

**Features**:
- 10,000 stars with color variation
- Circular texture (no square artifacts)
- Distance filtering (no close stars)
- Proper size attenuation for depth
